# m_tree

## This project has been abandoned but does have working code. If anyone is interested in it continuing raise an issue and I'll see what I can sort out!

## Synopsis

Implementation of an metric-tree data structure. M-trees are a structure designed to group together objects in a generic metric space given a distance function that satisifies some constraints. They are designed to allow for fast range queries and nearest neighbour queries for objects such as images with a high number of features making R-trees or other alternatives infeasible.

This project is current on going currently implemented are:

* Insertion, including the common split and promote functions.
* Range queries
* Nearest Neighbour queries

On the todo list are:

* Bulk loading
* Statistics (e.g. fat factor)
* Optimisation/thinning of tree
* Deletion
* Tests

## Code Example

Here is a simple example showing insertion and querying of an m-tree.

```cpp
//template arguments are: object reference, node capacity, distance function return value and id type
//distance function is an std::function object and examples will be in a the tests
auto tree = mt::m_tree<double, 3, double, size_t>(distance_function);
std::vector<size_t> insertions;
//insertion
for(size_t i=0; i<10; i++)
{
    insertions.push_back(std::make_shared<double>(static_cast<double>(rand()%100)));
    tree.insert(i, insertions.back());
}

//queries - these return a list of object ids in this case the index

//k nearest neighbour query
std::vector<size_t> knn = tree.knn_query(60, 3);
for(size_t i: knn)
{
    std::cout<<insertions[i]<<"\t";
}
//range query
std::vector<size_t> range = tree.range_query(40, 10);
for(size_t i: range)
{
    std::cout<<insertions[i]<<"\t";
}
std::cout<<std::endl;
```
